# Finch

This is the source code repository for the Finch (https://usefinch.co) project.

## What is it
Finch is a simple service that handles scheduled tasks for your apps, services. You can use the developer friendly API to create your tasks to be completed in a future date, periodically repeated. In plain English, you can create tasks like "Send a request to this URL with this JSON body every morning". That could save you a ton of work when just developing a to-do app.

For now it can send HTTP requests with GET, POST methods and request body of your choice, which can be plain text, form or JSON.
